				<B> Motivation </b><BR>
					
					Cloud-based online document editing services, such as Google Docs and Office 365, provide an inexpensive and efficient 
					means of managing documents.  However, storing data on cloud also raises certain security and privacy concerns, especially 
					when the data is of confidential and sensitive nature. Storing data on third-party servers can potentially be compromising 
					as it gives opportunity to the third-party cloud service providers to turn semi-honest and become curious about user data. 
					User data stored on third-party servers is <br/>also prone to attacks like virtual machine-based side-channel along with natural 
					language processing and machine learning-based content search and retrieval techniques. In a <br/>online editing 
					environment, user data should never be exposed to the cloud in plain text form. Thus, there is a need for secure collaborative 
					editing frameworks and services. Prior works around secure collaborative editing have several limitations, and some are not practical.

				<p>
					To that end, this work proposes a suite of frameworks, SecureCEdit and two variations of SecureC2Edit to secure user data 
					and enable co-authors of collaborative documents to <br/>keep their data confidential while providing collaborative editing services.
					<ul>
						<li>SecureCEdit is a client-server-based secure collaborative editing framework that provides collaborative access to users. 
							It encrypts user documents on the fly before <br/>committing them to cloud service providers. SecureCEdit uses 
							Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt document contents and is platform-independent, lightweight <br/>with minimal data and 
							resource requirements.</li>
							<BR>
						<li>SecureC2Edit is a structured peer-to-peer secure collaborative and concurrent editing framework. 
							It makes use of a novel Hybrid Differential Synchronization algorithm to facilitate both collaborative access and concurrent editing.
							<ul>
								<BR> 
							
								<li>The first variation of SecureC2Edit makes use of the symmetric encryption algorithm, AES to encrypt collaborative document contents. 
							The primary limitation of <br/>symmetric encryption, key distribution is overcome by a novel asynchronous key distribution algorithm.</li> 
							<BR> 
							
							<li>The second variation of SecureC2Edit is keyless and uses Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) as the security mechanism. 
							Use of SSS enables the framework to be synchronized on every edit, minimizing content loss, and scaling better on collaborative 
							documents with a large amount of data. The proposed frameworks and their variations are evaluated on performance and security.</li>
							</ul>
